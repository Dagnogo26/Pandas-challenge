# Pandas-challenge
This exercise is about analyzing both student and school data individually and finding similarities in other to merge them in one single data.
Merge allows to combine multiple data tables together in a nice and orderly fashion into a single dataframe for further analysis, in our case analysis budget, student math and reading scores, school type etc.
